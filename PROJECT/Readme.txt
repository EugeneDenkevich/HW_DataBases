Hi! This is my final project of course "Relational Databases and SQL".

There I implemented a simple database of grocery store and that contains tables like "client",
"product", "purchases"... 8 tables and 7 of them has some relations.

<<<<<<< HEAD
PS: run all the files in this sequence: "create_table.sql", "create_inserts.sql" and "create_views_triggers_procedures.sql"
Then go to file "create_selects.sql" and try some of writed selects.
=======
In a separate file you can see some indexes, views, triggers and procedures
wich I created specialy to show how can I use it. You can try all of it in a separate file which called "create_selects.sql"

PS: run all the files in this sequence: "create_table.sql", "create_inserts.sql", "create_views_triggers_procedures.sql".
