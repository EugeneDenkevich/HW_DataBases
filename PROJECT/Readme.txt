Hi! This is my final project of course "Relational Databases and SQL".

There I implemented a simple database of grocery store and that contains tables like "client",
"product", "purchases"... 8 tables and 7 of them has some relations.

In a separate file which is called "create_selects.sql" you can see some indexes, views, triggers and procedures
wich I created specialy to show how can I use it.

PS: run all the files in this sequence: "create_table.sql", "create_inserts.sql".
File "create_selects.sql" need optionally: if you've liked some trigger or procedure - just run it!
Enjoy! =)
